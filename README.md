# Projects Bundle
> In this repository I am going to create some of the small projects in seperate branches in my free time that can be helpful in my future job/work. It is because when I need some of the design or creating something interesting (such as login form, animated logo, etc), if I create or build them again and again why don't I create or built it once and whenever I need that I have to copy it from here and paste in the project with some small changes to save my time.
